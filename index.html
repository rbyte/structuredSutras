<p>The foundation of this page is the book <a href="http://www.parallax.org/product/awakening-of-the-heart-essential-buddhist-sutras-and-commentaries/"><b>Awakening of the Heart</b></a> by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, a discussion of the most essential buddhist discourses (sutras). The first 2 (of 9) are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#FullAwarenessOfBreathing"><span class="breath"><b>Full Awareness of Breathing</b></span></a> (Anapanasati Sutta → <a href="http://plumvillage.org/sutra/discourse-on-the-full-awareness-of-breathing/">source</a>)</li>
	<li><a href="#FourEstablishmentsOfMindfulness"><span class="fourE"><b>4 Establishments of Mindfulness</b></span></a> (Satipatthana Sutta → <a href="http://plumvillage.org/sutra/discourse-on-the-four-establishments-of-mindfulness/">source</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>He writes about the first:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>This sutra is so basic and so wonderful. There are many great sutras in this book, but approaching them without starting with the <i>Sutra on the <span class="breath">Full Awareness of Breathing</span></i> is like trying to reach the top of the mountain without taking a path.</q> [p.2]</p>

<p>This page is intended to <b>present them with readability and clarity</b> in mind, by the means of graphical layouting, structuring, reduction of redundancy and modest simplification. It is therefore my interpretation. Please read the source text to compare. The following adjustments have been made:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Coloured keywords and similar content coherently throughout.</li>
	<li>Converted enumerations verbalised in sentences to lists.</li>
	<li>Extracted redundant phrasing from lists to its head.</li>
	<li>Collapsed repetition of: <span class="breath"><i>breathing in</i></span> & <span class="breath"><i>breathing out</i></span> → <span class="breath"><i>in/out</i></span>.</li>
	<li>Highlighted <span class="highlight">repetitive structures in grey</span> and omitted its recurrence <span class="omission">...</span></li>
	<li>Highlighted <span class="highlightYellow">sections in yellow</span> and <b>keywords in bold</b>.</li>
	<li>Highlighted <span class="question">questions in red</span> (from the monks).</li>
	<li>Replaced interchangeable phrases (e.g. <i>the practitioner</i> → <i>she</i>) where appropriate for the sake of brevity.</li>
	<li>Meaningful headings instead of section numbers.</li>
	<li>Grouped paragraphs.</li>
	<li>Converted numerals: <i>one hundred</i> → <i>100</i>.</li>
	<li>Omitted superfluous quotation marks and italicised narrator.</li>
	<li>Added annotations (in parentheses).</li>
	<li>Added alternative translations [in square brackets].</li>
	<li>Supplemented structural simplifications with <i>[italic square brackets]</i>.</li>
	<li>Added emblems from the book.</li>

<section>
<p class="narrator">I heard these words of the Buddha one time when he was staying in Savatthi in the Eastern Park, with many well-known and accomplished disciples, including Sariputta, Mahamoggallana, Mahakassapa, Mahakacchayana, Mahakotthita, Mahakappina, Mahachunda, Anuradha, Revata, and Ananda. The senior bhikkhus (monks) in the community were diligently instructing bhikkhus who were new to the practice — some instructing 10 bhikkhus, some 20, some 30, and some 40; and in this way the bhikkhus who were new to the practice gradually made great progress.</p>

<p class="narrator">That night the moon was full, and the Pavarana Ceremony was held to mark the end of the rainy-season retreat. Lord Buddha, the Awakened One, was sitting in the open air, and his disciples were gathered around him. After looking over the assembly, he began to speak:</p>

<p>O bhikkhus, I am pleased to observe the fruit you have attained in your practice. Yet I know you can make even more progress. What you have not yet attained, you can attain. What you have not yet realized, you can realize perfectly. To engage your efforts, I will remain here until the next full-moon day.</p>

<p class="narrator">When they heard that the Lord Buddha was going to remain in Savatthi for another month, bhikkhus throughout the country began traveling there to study with him. The senior bhikkhus continued teaching the bhikkhus new to the practice even more ardently. Some were instructing 10 bhikkhus, some 20, some 30, and some 40. With this help, the newer bhikkhus were able, little by little, to continue their progress in understanding.</p>

<p class="narrator">When the next full-moon day arrived, the Buddha, seated under the open sky, looked over the assembly of bhikkhus and began to speak:</p>

<p>O bhikkhus, our community is pure and good. At its heart, it is without useless and boastful talk, and therefore it deserves to receive offerings and be considered a field of merit. Such a community is rare, and any pilgrim who seeks it, no matter how far he must travel, will find it worthy.</p>

<p>O bhikkhus, there are bhikkhus in this assembly who have realized the fruit of Arhatship, destroyed every root of affliction, laid aside every burden, and attained right understanding and emancipation. There are also bhikkhus who have cut off the first 5 internal knots and realized the fruit of never returning to the cycle of birth and death. There are those who have thrown off the first 3 internal knots and realized the fruit of returning once more. They have cut off the roots of greed, hatred, and ignorance, and will only need to return to the cycle of birth and death one more time. There are those who have thrown off the 3 internal knots and attained the fruit of stream-enterer, coursing steadily to the Awakened State.</p>
	
<p>There are those who practice:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the <span class="fourE"><b>4 Establishments of Mindfulness</b></span>,</li>
	<li>the <b>4 Right Efforts</b>,</li>
	<li>the <b>4 Bases of Success</b>,</li>
	<li>the <b>5 Faculties</b>,</li>
	<li>the <b>5 Powers</b>,</li>

	<li>the <b>9 Contemplations</b> (on death),</li>
	<li>the <b>Observation of Impermanence</b>.</li>
	<li>There are also bhikkhus who are already practicing <span class="breath"><b>Full Awareness of Breathing</b></span>.</li>

<section>
<h2 class="fourE">1. Body</h2>

<section>
<p class="question">And how does <span class="observe">a practitioner remain established in the observation of the</span> <span class="fourE">body</span> in the <span class="fourE">body</span>?</p>

<p>She goes to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty room, sits down cross-legged in the lotus position, holds her body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of her.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="breath">She breathes in/out</span>, <strong>aware that <span class="breath">she is breathing in/out</span></strong>.</li>
	<li><span class="highlight"><span class="breath">When she breathes in/out</span> a long breath, she knows, <q><span class="breath">I am breathing in/out</span> a long breath.</q></span></li>
	<li><span class="highlight"><span class="breath">When she breathes in/out</span> a short breath, she knows, <q><span class="breath">I am breathing in/out</span> a short breath.</q></span></li>
</ul>

<span class="highlight">She uses the following practice:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span class="highlight"><span class="breath">Breathing in/out</span>, I am aware of my whole body.</span></li>
	<li><span class="highlight"><span class="breath">Breathing in/out</span>, I calm my body.</span></li>
</ul>

<span>Just as a skilled potter knows:</span>
<ul>
	<li>when he makes a long turn on the wheel, <q>I am making a long turn.</q></li>
	<li>and knows when he makes a short turn, <q>I am making a short turn.</q></li>
</ul>
so <i>[does]</i> a practitioner <span class="omission">...</span>
</section>




<section>
<span>Moreover,</span>
<ul>
	<li>when a practitioner <b>walks</b>, <span class="breath">he is aware</span>, <q>I am walking.</q></li>
	<li>When he is <b>standing</b>, <span class="breath">he is aware</span>, <q>I am standing.</q></li>
	<li>When he is <b>sitting</b>, <span class="breath">he is aware</span>, <q>I am sitting.</q></li>
	<li>When he is <b>lying down</b>, <span class="breath">he is aware</span>, <q>I am lying down.</q></li>
</ul>

<p>In whatever position his body happens to be, he is <strong>aware of the position of his body</strong>.</p>

<span>Moreover,</span>
<ul>
	<li>when the practitioner is going forward or backward, <span class="breath">he applies full awareness to</span> his going forward or backward.</li>
	<li>When he looks in front or looks behind, bends down or stands up, <span class="breath">he also applies full awareness to</span> what he is doing.</li>
	<li><span class="breath">He applies full awareness to</span> wearing the sanghati robe or carrying the alms bowl.</li>
	<li>When he eats or drinks, chews, or savors the food, <span class="breath">he applies full awareness to</span> all this.</li>
	<li>When passing excrement or urinating, <span class="breath">he applies full awareness to</span> this.</li>
	<li>When he walks, stands, lies down, sits, sleeps or wakes up, speaks or is silent, <span class="breath">he shines his awareness on</span> all this.</li>
</ul>
</section>



<section>
<p>Further, the practitioner <strong>meditates on her very own body</strong> <span class="highlight">from the soles of the feet upwards and then from the hair on top of the head downwards, a body contained inside the skin and full of all the impurities which belong to the body: <q>Here is the hair of the head, the hairs on the body, the nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, bowels, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, synovial fluid, urine.</q></span></p>

<p>Bhikkhus, imagine a sack which can be opened at both ends, containing a variety of grains — brown rice, wild rice, mung beans, kidney beans, sesame, white rice. When someone with good eyesight opens the bags, he will review it like this: <q>This is brown rice, this is wild rice, these are mung beans, these are kidney beans, these are sesame seeds, this is white rice.</q> Just so the practitioner passes in review the whole of his body <span class="highlight">from <span class="omission">...</span></span></p>
</section>





<section>
<p>Further, in whichever position her body happens to be, <span class="highlight">the practitioner passes in review the <strong>elements which constitute the body</strong>: <q>In this body is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.</q></span></p>

<p>As a skilled butcher or an apprentice butcher, having killed a cow, might sit at the crossroads to divide the cow into many parts, <i>[just so does the practioner]</i> <span class="omission">...</span></p>
</section>




<section>
	<p><span class="highlight">Further, the practitioner <strong>compares his own body with a corpse</strong> which he visualizes thrown onto a charnel ground</span> and lying there for 1, 2, or 3 days — bloated, blue in color, and festering,
	<br/><span class="highlight">and he observes: <q>This body of mine is of the same nature. It will end up in the same way; there is no way it can avoid that state.</q></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="highlight">Further, <span class="omission">...</span></span>, pecked at by crows, eaten by hawks, vultures, and jackals, and infested with maggots and worms,
		<br/><span class="highlight">and he observes: <span class="omission">...</span></span></li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Further, <span class="omission">...</span></span>, it is just a skeleton with a little flesh and blood sticking to it, and the bones are held together by the ligaments.</li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Further, <span class="omission">...</span></span>, it is just a skeleton, no longer adhered to by any flesh, but still smeared by a little blood, the bones still held together by the ligaments.</li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Further, <span class="omission">...</span></span>, it is just a skeleton, no longer adhered to by any flesh nor smeared by any blood, but the bones are still held together by the ligaments.</li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Further, <span class="omission">...</span></span>; all that is left is a collection of bones scattered here and there; in one place a hand bone, in another a shin bone, a thigh bone, a pelvis, a spinal column, a skull.</li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Further, <span class="omission">...</span></span>; all that is left is a collection of bleached bones, the color of shells.</li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Further, <span class="omission">...</span></span>; it has been lying there for more than one year and all that is left is a collection of dried bones.</li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Further, <span class="omission">...</span></span>; all that is left is the dust which comes from the rotted bones,

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<section>
<p>Bhikkhus, he who practices the <span class="fourE">4 Establishments of Mindfulness</span> for 7 years can expect one of 2 fruits — the highest understanding in this very life or, if there remains some residue of affliction, he can attain the fruit of no-return.</p>

<p>Let alone 7 years, bhikkhus, whoever practices the <span class="fourE">4 Establishments of Mindfulness</span> for 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 years or 1 year, for 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 months, 1 month or half a month, can also expect one of 2 fruits — either the highest understanding in this very life or, if there remains some residue of affliction, he can attain the fruit of no-return.</p>

<p>That is why we said that this path, the path of the 4 grounds for the <span class="fourE">Establishment of Mindfulness</span>, is the most wonderful path, which helps beings realize purification, transcend grief and sorrow, destroy pain and anxiety, travel the right path, and realize nirvana.</p>
